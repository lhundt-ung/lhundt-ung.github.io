# Sandboxes

A sandbox is digital playground, an environment created for experimentation and fun. I'm creating sandbox content for **Intro to Applied Statistics** using Python's `datascience` package. The notebooks in this section are intended to make class examples using my own datasets easily accessible to my students.
